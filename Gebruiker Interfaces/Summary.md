## AppContainer
**AppContainer** is a design pattern used to manage dependencies and provide a central place to create and hold instances that need to be shared across the app. It's often used in conjunction with dependency injection frameworks like Dagger or Hilt. The container helps in setting up instances that should live as long as the app does and ensures that these instances are available where needed.
## Repository
**Repository** is a design pattern used to abstract the data layer, providing a clean API for data access to the rest of the application. It mediates between different data sources (e.g., network and local database) and the business logic in the ViewModel. Repositories handle data operations and provide a unified data interface, which makes it easier to manage data sources and caching strategies.
## ViewModel
**ViewModel** is a class designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. ViewModels are responsible for preparing and managing the data for an Activity or a Fragment. They survive configuration changes, like screen rotations, ensuring that the UI data is preserved and consistent. ViewModels also help in separating UI logic from business logic, adhering to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
## NavController
**NavController** is part of Android's Navigation Component, which is used to manage app navigation within the app. The NavController manages the navigation and the back stack of destinations within an app, handling fragment transactions, animations, and deep linking. It simplifies navigation and ensures that navigation operations are consistent and predictable.
## UI-state
**UI-state** refers to the current state of the user interface, encompassing everything the UI displays and how it behaves at any given time. This includes data displayed on the screen, loading states, error messages, and user interactions. Managing UI-state effectively ensures that the UI reflects the latest data and responds appropriately to user actions and lifecycle events.
## UI-elements
**UI-elements** are the building blocks of an app's user interface, including buttons, text fields, images, and other components that users interact with. These elements are defined in XML layouts or programmatically in Kotlin. In Jetpack Compose, UI-elements are defined as composables. Proper management of UI-elements is crucial for creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
## Data Layer
The **Data Layer** is responsible for managing data sources and performing data-related operations. It includes components like databases, network services, and repositories. The data layer abstracts the complexity of data management from the rest of the application, providing a clean and consistent API for accessing and modifying data.
## Room
**Room** is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. Room simplifies database interactions, reducing boilerplate code and providing compile-time validation of SQL queries. It supports RxJava, LiveData, and Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous database operations.
## Coroutines
**Coroutines** are a Kotlin feature that enables asynchronous programming by providing a way to execute long-running tasks without blocking the main thread. Coroutines simplify concurrency by allowing developers to write asynchronous code in a sequential, readable manner. They are essential for performing background tasks like network requests and database operations efficiently.
## Composables
**Composables** are functions in Jetpack Compose that define the UI elements and their behavior. Each composable function can be combined with others to build complex user interfaces. Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI, and it leverages composables to create a more declarative and reactive approach to UI development, where the UI automatically updates in response to state changes.

These principles and components are essential in modern Android development, helping to create scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications.
