## Difference:
- State
	- Is cold, meaning data is produced only when requested
	- Objects don't get notified but must request from the Flow
	- Ideal for databases, etc.
- StateFlow
	- Is hot, always contains the most recent/up-to-date value
	- Notifies observers when value changes
	- Ideal for notifying observers
- MutableStateFlow
	- Same a StateFlow, but allows for the value to assigned a new value
		- Ideal for situations where your program logic indicates it has completed something
	- Triggers a recompose on observers
